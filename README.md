# js-basics
This repository contains all the JavaScript fundamentals I practiced during Week 5 of my web development journey with SIGMA 8.0 by Apna College.

ðŸ“š What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far
This week was all about unlocking the logic behind websites. JavaScript helped me go from static to interactive, and hereâ€™s what I explored:

ðŸ§  Understanding JavaScript as a programming language

ðŸ”¤ Working with datatypes, strings, numbers, and booleans

ðŸ”„ Exploring loops (for, while) and conditionals (if-else, switch)

ðŸ§° Learning how to write and call functions

ðŸ“¦ Understanding local vs global scope

ðŸ”— Linking JavaScript to HTML to bring pages to life

ðŸ’¡ Mini Projects I Built

ðŸŽ¬ Guess the Movie â€“ test your Bollywood guessing skills

ðŸ”¢ Random Number Game â€“ generate and guess a number

âœ… To-Do List App â€“ add, delete, and manage your tasks

This repo captures my first steps into JavaScript and frontend logic.
Each file here is a piece of the puzzle â€” one that made coding feel less like code, and more like creativity. âœ¨

May this collection help you in your own learning journey â€”
just like it helped me connect the dots. ðŸŒ±ðŸš€
